Sam Rodgers-Melnick, MPH, MT-BC is a music therapist, integrative health research & data specialist at [University Hospitals Connor Whole Health](https://www.uhhospitals.org/services/integrative-health-network?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=CIHN|Search-Paid|Google|CIHN-General&campaignid=CIHN|Search-Paid|Google|CIHN-General&gclid=CjwKCAjwo7iiBhAEEiwAsIxQEXHS7sftl3N47aL6xmYl8yqe18ccxvaZyaMfw9Arm6gDaEiKcJrWSRoCdK8QAvD_BwE) in Cleveland, OH, and a PhD student in the [Clinical Translational Science PhD program](https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/education/clinical-and-translational-science/phd-clinical-translational-science-cts) at Case Western Reserve University.

As a music therapist at [University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center](https://www.uhhospitals.org/services/cancer-services), Sam developed several interventions directed at improving pain management outcomes for adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Sam served as Principal Investigator for two consecutive research grants from the [Kulas Foundation](https://www.murphykulas.org/copy-of-kulas-home-1) (Cleveland, OH) that funded music therapy research studies in SCD. These studies included 1) a mixed-methods RCT investigating the effects of music therapy on acute pain in patients with SCD receiving care in an outpatient infusion center; 2) a study investigating the effects of the BEATS (Build Educate Advance Transition in Sickle cell disease) music therapy program on self-efficacy, trust, knowledge, and adherence in young adults with SCD; 3) a survey of music use in 100 adults with SCD; and 4) a mixed-methods RCT investigating the effects of a multi-session intervention on quality of life and chronic pain in individuals with SCD.

Sam currently serves as a co-investigator for Effectiveness of Medical Music Therapy Practice: Integrative Research using the Electronic Health Record (EMMPIRE). EMMPIRE includes a series of studies examining the clinical effectiveness of tens of thousands of music therapy sessions addressing patient-reported outcomes across ten University Hospitals medical centers. Sam also applies his electronic health record, data collection, and data mining skills to various projects investigating the effectiveness of integrative therapies throughout the University Hospitals Health System.

Sam has presented at numerous national meetings for organizations including the [Sickle Cell Disease Association of America](https://www.sicklecelldisease.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwo7iiBhAEEiwAsIxQEW4n-WDrK80Mg4sxPRdsQxd_OmPEibLlHijhoQSNKb9F9Wba5qb5LxoCuzYQAvD_BwE), [Foundation for Sickle Cell Disease Research](https://www.fscdr.org/), [American Music Therapy Association](https://www.musictherapy.org/), [Society for Integrative Oncology](https://integrativeonc.org/), and the [Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health](https://imconsortium.org/).
